NumPy, short for Numerical Python, serves as a fundamental library for numerical and scientific computing in Python. It introduces support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, alongside an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. NumPy arrays, also known as ndarrays, are more memory-efficient and facilitate faster computations compared to Python's built-in lists, particularly when dealing with large datasets. 

Key features of NumPy include:

**ndarray:** A powerful N-dimensional array object for storing and manipulating numerical data.

**Vectorized operations:** Enables performing mathematical operations on entire arrays without explicit loops, leading to faster execution.

**Broadcasting:** Allows operations between arrays of different shapes without the need for explicit reshaping.

**Mathematical functions:** Provides a wide range of mathematical functions for array operations, including linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.

**Integration with other libraries:** Forms the foundation for many other scientific computing libraries in Python, such as Pandas, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
